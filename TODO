Convenience methods to handle parens and sequences
Add try functionality:
 - python context manager
 - sets up array in parser where previous tokens are stored by next_token
 - prev state of array stored
 - on fail, prev tokens transfered to token_stack, and previous state restored
 - can use to implement opt_n, but also opt expression parsing
